# Introduction

CTFjx is a fast, lightweight, and security-first Linux-first CTF platform.
Built for hackers, by hackers.

## Why we made it?

Most CTF platforms today are slow, heavy, and frustrating to work with.
They're often tied to bloated stacks, painful to customize, and feel
like they fight you every step of the way.

We built CTFjx because we wanted something better â€” fast, minimal, and developer-friendly.
Fully open-source, self-hostable, and designed to **Just Work**.

## Use cases

- University or club CTFs
- Internal red team training
- Personal challenge hosting
- Local/offline CTF environments
- Teaching InfoSec basics

We can't want to see what awesome CTFs you will host!
